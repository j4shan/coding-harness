# Project metadata guideline

**Objective.** Keep project-owned documents and authored assets in a fixed tree so later
sessions find requirements, contracts, plans, and exhibits in one place.

**Your tasks.** Maintain the product spec, place project metadata, and place authored
resources. Each section states when it applies.

## 1. Requirement Housekeeping Guidelines

1. Collect user-specified product and system design requirements from chat messages. Maintain
   documented product requirement and system design specs in the `project_metadata/` directory.
2. Before executing an update action, such as a code modification or CRUD data operation, present
   requirement updates as a numbered list and prompt the user to confirm with `1. Yes` or `2. No`.
   Do this only when the update request introduces a new product or system design requirement.
3. Apply this guideline to UI, backend, data, and project settings. Collect, compare, and update
   only explicit requirements given by the user. Exclude automatic design decisions.
4. Write each explicit product or system design requirement into the matching category document.
   Create that document if it does not exist. Leave the documents unchanged when the user states no
   new requirement.
5. Never write a decision the system made and the user did not confirm. Examples include a UI
   widget theme, colour code, or size. Never write implementation guidelines, tools, dependencies,
   or build processes unless the user explicitly requests them as requirements.

## 2. Static Resource Housekeeping

1. Put project-owned writing and generation contracts in `project_metadata/instructions/`, relative
   to the project root. Create the directory when it does not exist.
2. Keep authored exhibit and fixture assets under `resources/`, relative to the project root. Never
   put temporary or git-ignored resources there.

   - Put authored HTML, canvases, and formal documents in `resources/html/`.
   - Put figures in `resources/img/`.
   - Put figure prompts in `resources/img_prompt/`.
   - Put authored scenario and fixture data in `resources/data/`. Never put runtime-generated data
     there.

## 3. Project Plan Housekeeping

Put transient execution plans in `project_metadata/plans/`, relative to the project root. Create the
directory when it does not exist. Never version these plans.

## 4. Document Locations & Format

Store requirement documents in these locations, relative to the project root. Create a missing
location or document when required.

| Requirement document | Location | Category labels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product requirements | `project_metadata/product/<category>/` | `UI`, `backend`, `data`, `project_setting` |
| System design requirements | `project_metadata/system_design/<category>/` | `UI`, `backend`, `data`, `project_setting` |

## 5. Requirement Clause Format

- When writing a requirement clause, give it a hierarchical dotted ID, such as `1.2.3`, that is
  unique within its requirement document. Clause IDs do not need to be contiguous.
- When a clause is superseded or the user retires its requirement, remove the clause. Never strike
  it through or annotate it, and never renumber remaining clauses to fill the gap.
- When updating a requirement document, keep it as a snapshot of current requirements, not a
  version history.

## 6. Integration in Coding Workflow

- When a user request updates requirements, detect conflicting or duplicate clauses and prompt
  the user to reconcile them.
- When modifying code or performing a CRUD data operation, read the matching requirement
  documents first. If a requirement and the implementation disagree, state which one is defective
  and fix that one. Never silently reword a requirement to match the implementation.
- When a coding task completes or a code review session begins, validate the changes against
  functional requirements and implementation guidelines.
- Never test or run experiments for non-functional requirements, such as latency, throughput, or
  subjective ranking, unless the user explicitly requests it.
